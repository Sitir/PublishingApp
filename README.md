How to prepare app to be successfully accepted by reviewers

Mostly I published apps build in Ionic(Cordova Webview apps ak. Hybrid). Is more simply when you have to create one app on 2 diffrent system. In my case (iOS and Android never done it on Windows mobile).

But all are the same, screenshots, privacy, content, it's just another way to creating mobile apps using web features.

### Privacy
This is important thing when you use user data such as saving informations on device or getting it from the device. 

For example it can be "access to gallery of user" it has to have permission and policy(mostly web site where is written what you do with the things and what happen when you have security breach and it can expose user data in this case images). Make sure to descripe what are you doing with the (in this case gallery) do you just save or read? Or maybe you upload to your server.
